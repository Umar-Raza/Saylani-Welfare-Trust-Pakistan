<p><strong>السلام علیکم</strong></p>
    <br>
    Who is that whould loan so <b>ALLAH</b> a goodly loan so <b>H</b>e may multiply it for him many times over?
    (سورہ بقرہ)
    <br>
<p>
    it shouldbe noted that <b>ALLAH</b> who is in need of no one and nithing, instills upon his men give
    <b>Q</b>arz-e-<b>H</b>asana becouse it is man's nature to be furgal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks
    about qarz becouse it is returend and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah
    convays his message to the Muslim Ummah through the Holy Prophet <b>Muhammad</b>صلی للہ علیہ وسلم promotimg
    Muslims to spend ther wealth in a certain way. he says, Oh childern of Adam! trust me with your wealth. if you
    do so, no fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. <b>I</b>nstead, you will be envoled
    with your wealth when you most need it.<B>H</B>e futher says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and
    naked expect due to the negligence of rich, Who should not stingy in spending their money on those worse off
    themselves. <b>A</b>llah will nit only take strict accountability from those people but <b>H</b>e will also
    punish them accordingly. On the Day of Judgment, the rich will be humiliated becouse they did not help the
    needy. The needy will complai tp <b>A</b>llah nad say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the
    rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending o themselves and forget about us.
    the ones who needed it. <b>A</b>llah will reply to this and say:" <b>I</b> swear on my respect and glory!
    <b>I</b> will bring you closer to me and push them further away."

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    الحمدللہ, <b>A</b>llah has accorded Saylani Welfare with the heighest faver by sending those people our way who
    follow the teaching of <b>H</b>oly <b>Q</b>uran and hadith, give zakat fidyah, fitra, khairat and other
    donations to help us help those in need. <B>T</B>he purpuse of sending this massage to you is so that you not
    only spread this massage but also play your part in helping us to comtinuse serving and helping the needy till
    the <b>D</b>ay of <B>J</B>udgment.
