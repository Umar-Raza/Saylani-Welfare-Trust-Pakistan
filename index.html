    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Established in May <strong>1999</strong> by famous spiritual and religious scholar <strong>Maulana Bashir Ahmed
            Farooqui</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Saylani Welfare International Trust</strong> was built on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of
        poverty, alleviating the financial troubles of the poor, giving people a chance to live a dignified life and
        spreading happiness.</p>
    <br>
    <p> We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of underprivileged people across the world. We
        endeavor to provide the best quality services in areas including food, education, medical and social welfare
        free of cost to people living in the dark. With over <strong> 63</strong> different sectors, we feed thousands
        of hungry people each day, hundreds more are given the hope of life through medical health care, many are
        educated to become leaders of tomorrow and several are given the opportunity to stand on their feet financially.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, we are proud to say that our physical presence extends throughout Pakistan with a vast network of 125
        branches operating in major cities including <strong>Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad and
            Faisalabad</strong>. Apart from Pakistan, we have overseas offices in the <strong>UK, USA and UAE</strong>
        as well. Our worldwide branches are operating under the guidance of a team of over <strong>3,500</strong>
        working professionals who help almost<strong> 150,000</strong> people on a daily basis.</p>
    <h1>MISSION</h1>
    <p>We strongly believe that a little help goes a long way and our work would not be possible without the generous
        support of our valuable donors. Our local and international donors have graciously lent us a hand by supporting
        our causes and enabling us to serve the needs of people in need.</p>
